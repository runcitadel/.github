</p>

Citadel is modern, mostly open source and soon to be fully FLOSS Bitcoin Node implementation originally based on [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel),
but we have moved most of our codebase away from Umbrel.
Our node provides the latest apps, together with our own, up-to-date user interface and backend.

### Our mission

We want to build secure Bitcoin nodes and personal servers for everyone where **you** are in control of your data, not a big company.

### How?

Citadel provides a way to run a Bitcoin node or a personal server (or both) on a Raspberry Pi.
We also make contributions to various open source projects used on Citadel to make sure we're giving back to the community we build on.

### Who is building this?

- [@swedishfrenchpress](https://github.com/swedishfrenchpress) - Designer
